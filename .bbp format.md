# The Bristol Board Project File Extension
The .bbp extension will be used in this project to store the locations and size of objects placed on the board as well as the board setup (size, type).

## Format of the .bbp
An example of a .bbp project could look like this:

`[comments can be placed in square brackets]`

`tf 22 28 in #FFFFFF [The first line of the bbp will be to define the project board (tri-fold, 22x28 inches, White (in hexadecimal))]`

`[The rest of the lines are objects placed on the project board. Each separate item will be on a separate line, each property will be separated by a single space they are in the order of (object type) (x),(y) (object properties (this will give a path to a file for images, and a string for text boxes))]`

`tb 20,-50 10,20 "Information is great!" Arial [textbox x:20,y:-50 length:10,width:20 textbox text: Information is great Font: Arial]`

`img 40,-50 "Some random image.png" border:20 [image x:40,y:-50 image name: Some random image.png border size: 20 pixels, default values will be used for other unspecified properties]`
